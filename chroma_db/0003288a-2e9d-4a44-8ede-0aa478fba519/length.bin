Support Vector Machines
• This model is similar to logistic regression in that it is driven by a linear function
wTx+b. Unlike logistic regression, the support vector machine does not provide
probabilities, but only outputs a class identity.
• The SVM predicts that the positive class is present when wTx+b is positive.
Likewise, it predicts that the negative class is present when wTx+b is negat
